# omakub-on-wsl

The [Omakub][omakub] project is a great way to setup a fresh Ubuntu 24.04 machine for web development. 
Unfortunately, it can't be used directly on a Ubuntu instance running in the Windows Subsystem for Linux,
as it will try to install applications like Chrome, Spotify or Typora on Linux and not on the host OS.

## Windows Applications:

By default, Omakub will install the following GUI applications and, fortunately, all of them have Windows versions:

* [Alacritty](https://alacritty.org/)
* [Basecamp](https://basecamp.com/via)
* [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/)
* [FlameShot](https://flameshot.org/#download)
* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
* [Hey](https://www.hey.com/apps/)
* [Signal](https://signal.org/download/)
* [Typora](https://typora.io/)
* [VLC](https://www.videolan.org/)
* [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
* [WhatsApp](https://www.whatsapp.com/download)
* [Xournal](https://xournalpp.github.io/)

It is recommended to manually install them on Windows.
